# Cloud-Chamber-particle-tracking

Tracks the trajectories of Alpha and Beta particles in a Cloud Chamber detector and exports the tracked trajectories along with the linear fit of the trajectories. The program utilises the **EasyBMP** library to operate on a series of images that are snapshots of the Cloud Chamber detector at various time.

## Getting Started

The program is tuned to process **Grayscale** images, for coloured images please edit the **ImportImage.cpp**

## Run

Execute the program like it is displayed in the **Source.cpp** file. Optimal results can be achieved with the use of Intel C++ compilers and MPI libraries.
